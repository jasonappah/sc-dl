# sc-dl

This is a simple CLI written in Python that downloads all of a SoundCloud user's liked tracks to a directory of a user's choice.

## Running
This project uses `poetry` for dependency management, so make sure you have that installed, then run `poetry install` to install the project's dependencies. Running the CLI is as simple as running `python3 main.py`. To view options that you can set, run `python3 main.py --help`

PRs/issues welcome!
